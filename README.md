[Note Taking Web App](https://github.com/Diegopie/Team-Profile-Generator/) is hosted on GitHub.

## Outcome

This app was a way to practice creating express servers and hosting with Heroku. I struggled with writing the API routes at first but Postman certainly makes that easier to handle and I've been able to wrap my head around it.

## Future Development

The current version is not robust, as it was just practice with Express and API routes. First, I would like to refactor this app to work as a PWA. Part of that would include connecting this app with a Sequel database. Then I can research working with Passport.js to create user accounts.  

## Collaborators

This application relies on Bootstrap, jQuery, and Expressg
